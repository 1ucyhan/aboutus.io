# ðŸ’­ about us page
this was an assignment from my web dev internship! i fixed up the image carousels, UI, color schemes, and page organization because the original one didn't fit in well with our branding. 

i needed a way to show this project's code to my team, so i uploaded here. pretty happy with how it turned out :)
